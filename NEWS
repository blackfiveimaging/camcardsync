Changes for 0.1.1

*	Added an exclusion list.  Allows the user to specify a list of folder
	names which will be ignored when building the list of files.
	Useful if you wish to set the CamCardSync source directory to /media
	but exclude CD rom drives, etc.

*	Now only the most recently shot session will be checked by default.
