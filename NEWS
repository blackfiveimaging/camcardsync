Changes for 0.1.1

*	Is now smarter about which "sessions" are checkmarked by default:
	If a target directory for the given date doesn't already exist, the
	session will be checkmarked.
	If a target directory already exists, but none of the files in the 
	session already exists, the session will be checkmarked.
	If the target directory already exists and some or all of the files
	already exist, the session will not be checkmarked.

*	Added an exclusion list.  Allows the user to specify a list of folder
	names which will be ignored when building the list of files.
	Useful if you wish to set the CamCardSync source directory to /media
	but exclude CD rom drives, etc.
