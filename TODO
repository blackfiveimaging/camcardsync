Need to create some heuristic for automatically checking checkboxes based on whether
a target directory of the appropriate name already exists.
Perhaps better would be to scan the target directory if it exists and check whether any of
the files within that session already exist - if so, assume that these files have been
transferred and sorted, and some deleted.  If none of the files in that session exist,
assume that photos for that date came from another card, so this one should be synced.



Need a utility to ease the transfer of images from a camera card to a hard-drive directory.

Need the following features:

/ * Must be able to scan recursively the source directory and make a list of files,
/  including their timestamps.


/ * Must create directories in a specified target location for each date, and
/   copy the files created on that day to that directory.

/ * Need a binary copy routine

/ * Need some kind of progress callback.  Already have a routine to count the images;
/   Need to increment a "current image" counter somewhere.


Need to match the provided directory against "/org/freedesktop/Hal/" and if
matching, use the hal querying commands to fetch the mount-point.
This will obviate the need for a bootstrap script and allow camcardsync
to be used directly with GNOME.
(Gnome has since changed - nautilus now spawns a program to handle removable media
and it seems your choice is now f-spot or nothing. :( )

Config database needed with the following options:
* File extensions
* Destination path
* Default source path (over-ridden if provided on command line)

UI:

* Create some command line options - including --destination for output dir.

* Must present a list of dates to the user, with a checkbox alongside each one

* Must allow each datewise collection to be previewed.  However, reading of
  thumbnails, etc. must not be triggered until they're requested - avoid unneccesary
  reads over USB 1.1

* Must allow the user to set file extensions to be matched.

* Must allow destination directory to be set.


How about alternative backends?  Mtools?  Gphoto?
